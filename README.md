## Project Title: Facial Image Based Emotion Detection and Music Recommendation System

In Endsem project we are submitting two files, one (*IR_Endsem_ProjectCode.ipynb*) containing the models that we have tried to increase system performance and second file (*EmotionRecognition_And_MusicRecommendation.ipynb*) predict emotions and suggest music on specific data.

For running the first '.ipynb' file you need: *dumped dataset and models*.
For running the second '.ipynb' file you need: *dumped models*.
