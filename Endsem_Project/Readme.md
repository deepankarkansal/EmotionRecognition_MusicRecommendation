# This folder contains codes that we submit in the endsem project.

A readme file (pdf format) containing info about, how to run the codes is provided in this folder.

**Various Libraries that we used are :**

1. numpy  (library used to works with arrays and math calculations like linear algebra, fourier tranform etc.)
2. ast  (library helps Python applications to process trees of the Python abstract syntax grammar.)
3. io  (The io module provides Python's main facilities for dealing with various types of I/O.)
4. pandas  (Pandas is used to analyze data.)
5. matplotlib  (Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.)
6. imblearn  (Imbalanced-learn is a python package offering a number of re-sampling techniques commonly used in datasets showing strong between-class imbalance.)
7. scipy  (SciPy is a scientific computation library that uses NumPy underneath.)
8. sklearn  (Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python.)
9. tensorflow  (TensorFlow provides a collection of workflows to develop and train models using Python.)
10. cv2  (OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.)
11. keras  (Keras is a Python library used for developing and evaluating deep learning models.)
12. seaborn  (Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib.)
13. random  (Random module is a built-in module to generate the pseudo-random variables.)
14. joblib  (Joblib is part of the SciPy ecosystem and provides utilities for pipelining Python jobs.)
